Given the coordinates of the centres of two circles (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) as well as the radii of the respective circles R1 and R2.Find the floor of the area of their intersection.
Note: Use the value of Pi as 3.14

Example:
Input:
X1=0,Y1=0,R1=4
X2=6,Y2=0,R2=4
Output:
7
Explanation:
The intersecting area equals 7.25298806.
So,Answer is 7.
